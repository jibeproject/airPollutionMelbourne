# Introduction

This document compares emission factors for Manchester and Melbourne.  Manchester factors are from HBEFA; Melbourne factors are produced by COPERT Australia, and processed in _*emission factors.R*_.

COPERT Australia is an average speed model, unlike HBEFA which is a traffic situation model. The first ('unspread') set of comparisons in this document use Melbourne hot factors which (unlike the Manchester factors) do not include a 'TrafficSit' field with mutliple traffic situations.  Instead, they have a 'RoadCat' field, with only 3 options: 'Urban', 'Rural' and 'Highway'.  Similarly, the 'unbspread' Melbourne cold start factors used in this document (unlike the Manchester factors) do not include an 'AmbientCondPattern' field.  These factors are referred to as the 'unspread' factors.

A subsequent processing step in _*emission factors.R*_ produces final Melbourne factors which do include 'TrafficSit' and 'AmbientCondPattern' fields.  These are produced by shaping the unspread factors to match the spread of the Manchester factors across those fields.

# Compare unspread hot emissions

The plots below compare Melbourne (Urban, Rural and Highway) values with the range of Manchester 'TrafficSit' values, for each pollutant ('Component') and vehicle category ('VehCat') combination.  For each combination, there is a set of plots showing the different gradient values.

The Components covered are 'NO2', 'PM2.5' and 'PM2.5 (non-exhaust)'.  The VehCats covered are 'pass. car', 'LCV', 'HGV' and 'urban bus'.

Because of the large number of Manchester 'TrafficSit' values, the y-axis of each plot is very crowded, so the plot sets in this document will only give an impressionistic view of how the Melbourne <span style="background-color: blue; color: white;">blue</span> values compare against the overall set of Manchester <span style="background-color: lightgrey;">grey</span> values.  A full set of individual plots is also saved to the _*EFA_plots*_ directory, and can be viewed there to show more detail than is visible in the compressed plots in this document.

```

The table below shows the Melbourne hot values as a proportion of the mean Manchester values.  For example, a value of '1' would mean that the Melbourne value equals the Manchester value; '0.5' would mean that the Melbourne value is half of the Manchester value.

For this purpose, only the Melbourne Urban and Rural values are used (not Highway).  They are compared to the mean of the Manchester values with an 'URB' or 'RUR' TrafficSit respectively.  Note that comparison to the mean gives only a rough-and-ready comparison; a more accurate comparison would require a weighted mean of the Manchester values, with weights determined by the distance travelled in each TrafficSit category.

The table <span style="background-color: orange;">highlights</span> Melbourne values which are less than half or more than double the corresonding mean Manchester value.

```{r hot table 1, echo=FALSE}

# calculate means of Manchester hot Urban and Rural values
manch_hot_means <- manch_hot %>%
  
  # categorise as Urban or Rural
  mutate(RoadCat = case_when(
    str_detect(TrafficSit, "^URB/") ~ "Urban",
    str_detect(TrafficSit, "^RUR/") ~ "Rural"
  )) %>%
  
  # mean for each RoadCat and Gradient
  group_by(Component, RoadCat, VehCat, Gradient) %>%
  summarise(manch_value = mean(EFA_weighted)) %>%
  ungroup()

            by = c("Component", "RoadCat", "VehCat", "Gradient")) %>%

           )
    )
  ) %>%
  kable(format = "html", escape = F) %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

The next table shows a similar comparison, but also using the Melbourne Highway values.  For this comparison, Manchester 'Motorway-Nat.' and 'Semi-Motorway' values (whether Urban or Rural) are compared to Melbourne Highway values.  Other Manchester Urban and Rural values continue to be compared to Melbourne Urban and Rural values respectively.

That is, the green traffic situations in the diagram below are treated as 'Highway', while the others continue to be treated as 'Urban' or 'Rural'.

## Comments on hot emissions

- There is little difference between the results in the two tables.  The comments below use figures from the second table (Urban/Rural/Highway), but similar comments apply to the figures from the first table (Urban/Rural).

- For **NO2 emissions**, the Melbourne values are much lower than the Manchester values, for all categories except HGV.  For example, considering the table comparing Melbourne values with mean Manchester values, for Urban passenger cars, the Melbourne values are around 10% of the Manchester values.  For Urban HGV, the difference is smaller, though at 0% gradient the Melbourne values are still only around 50% the mean Manchester values.  And for HGV, the spread between values for negative and positive gradients is greater for Melbourne than for Manchester, with the Melbourne negative gradient values being much lower than the Manchester values, and the Melbourne positive gradient values being much higher.  For example, for Urban HGV, at 0% the Melbourne values are 0.55 times the Manchester values; at -6% the Melbourne values are 0.04 times the Manchester Values; and at +6% the Melbourne values are 1.72 times the Manchester values.

- The **PM2.5** Melbourne values are generally closer to the Manchester values, especially at 0% gradient.  For example, for Urban passenger cars, the Melbourne values are 0.83 times the Manchester values.  However, as with NO2 values, the spread between values for negative and positive gradients is greater for Melbourne than for Manchester.  For example, for Urban passenger cars, the Melbourne values are 0.22 and 1.38 times the Manchester values for -6% and +6% respectively.

- For **PM2.5 (non-exhaust)**, note that there is no variation by gradient.  For Urban LCV, the Melbourne values are very close to the Manchester values (0.94).  However, for other categories the Melbourne values are much lower, ranging from 0.11 to 0.34 times the Manchester values.

# Compare unspread cold start emissions

The plots below compare the Melbourne values (which are all Urban) with the range of Manchester 'AmbientCondPattern' values (which, again, are all for Urban roads), for each pollutant ('Component') and vehicle category ('VehCat') combination.  

The Components covered are 'NO2' and 'PM2.5'. 'PM2.5 (non-exhaust)' is not relevant (and not provided for either city) as it relates to tyre, brake and road abrasion emissions which do not occur merely as a result of starting the vehicle .  While the VehCats covered in the Melbourne cold start data are 'pass. car', 'LCV', 'HGV' and 'urban bus', the Manchester cold start data only includes 'pass. car' and 'LCV'.  Accordingly, plots are only produced for these VehCats.

A full set of plots is also saved to the _*EFA_plots*_ directory, and can be viewed there.

```{r cold plots, echo=FALSE}
# set up folder to store results
output.dir <- "./EFA_plots"
if (!dir.exists(output.dir)) dir.create(output.dir)

# compile data for comparison
colddata <- bind_rows(
  manch_cold %>% mutate(city = "Manchester", label = paste0(RoadCat, "_", AmbientCondPattern)),
  melb_cold %>% mutate(city = "Melbourne", label = RoadCat)
)

plot_cold <- function(colddata, component, veh_cat) {
  plotdata <- colddata %>%
    filter(VehCat == veh_cat & Component == component)

  # only proceed where more than one city to compare (Manchester lacks HGV and bus)
  if (length(plotdata$city %>% unique()) > 1) {

    p <- ggplot(plotdata) +
    geom_col(aes(x = EFA_weighted, 
                 y = fct_reorder(label, EFA_weighted, .desc = TRUE), 
                 fill = city)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightgrey", "blue")) +
    labs(title = paste0("cold start - ", component, " - ", veh_cat),
         x = paste0(component, " (g/start)"),
         y = "Road category and ambient condition pattern (if available)",
         fill = "City") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))

  print(p)

  ggsave(paste0(output.dir, "/cold ", component, " ", veh_cat, ".png"),
         plot = p, device = "png", width = 20, height = 15, units = "cm")
  }
}

# plot the values for all combinations (noting that Manchester lacks HGV and urban bus)
for (component in colddata$Component %>% unique()) {
  for (veh_cat in colddata$VehCat %>% unique()) {
      plot_cold(colddata, component, veh_cat)
  }
}

```

The table below shows the Melbourne cold start values as a proportion of the mean Manchester values.  For example, a value of '1' would mean that the Melbourne value equals the Manchester value; '0.5' would mean that the Melbourne value is half of the Manchester value.

Only Urban values are shown (because both Melbourne and Manchester only have values for Urban roads).  And only 'pass. car' and 'LCV' values are shown, because Manchester does not have values for 'HCV' or 'urban bus' (though Melboune does).

The Melbourne Urban values are compared to the mean of the values for all Manchester AmbientCondPattern categories.  Note that comparison to the mean gives only a rough-and-ready comparison; a more accurate comparison would require a weighted mean of the Manchester values, with weights determined by the distance travelled in each AmbientCondPattern category.

The table <span style="background-color: orange;">highlights</span> Melbourne values which are less than half or more than double the corresonding mean Manchester value.

```{r cold table, echo=FALSE}

# calculate means of Manchester cold values (Urban only; pass.car and LCV only)

## Comments on cold start emissions

Looking at the table comparing Melbourne values with mean Manchester values, for passenger cars, the Melbourne values are almost double the Manchester values for both NO2 and PM2.5.

For LCV, the Melbourne PM2.5 values are over 7 times the Manchester values.  For LCVs, the Manchester NO2 values are negative figures.  It is understood that this is intended, with the total emissions being a combination of the hot and cold start values.

# Compare spread hot emissions

This part of the document re-runs the hot emission plots above using the 'spread' emissions, where the Melbourne Urban, Rural and Highway emissions have been spread into multiple 'TrafficSit' categories, to match the shape of the spread of equivalent Manchester emissions.  For this purpose, for each combination of vehicle, road category and pollutant, a reference Manchester traffic situation is selected, being the traffic situation with the closest speed (V_weighted) to the average speed used by COPERT Australia.  Factors for the Manchester traffic situations are calculated as the emission for the traffic situation divided by the emission for the reference situation.  Each of the Melbourne Urban, Rural and Highway emission values is then spread into multiple traffic situations, by multiplying the value by the Manchester factor for that traffic situation.
